      <h1>What Tools Should I Use?</h1>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/help.html">“Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.” - Ernest Hemingway</blockquote>
      <p>Simply put, the best tool is often the tool least likely to <em>get in the way</em>. Here on this page, we'll go over three of the best options as far as tools that will do everything you might need of them as a writer, while still getting out of the way to let you work when needed.</p>
      <h2 id="scrivener">Scrivener: The Premier Writing App. </h2>
      <p>Scrivener is perhaps the world's best known software for writing novels, and for good reasons:</p>
      <ol class="square">
        <li>Scrivener leaves behind the UI of microsoft word. While there are a <strong>lot</strong> of tools embedded in it's interface, every one of them is related to longform writing.</li>
        <li>Focused Reading Mode. With this mode turned on, all of the controls fade away, leaving just you and the page to write on.</li>
        <li>Notebooks. not only does Scrivener keep all of your sections and chapters together in one project file, you can even store notes and images to reference as you work.</li>
        <li>Extensive timeline and storyboarding tools.</li>
        <li>An <strong>extremely</strong> powerful exporter for when it's time to submit your project.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="wavemaker"><a href="https://wavemaker.cards">WaveMaker</a>: Write Everywhere</h2>
      <p>Unlike Scrivener, WaveMaker runs entirely over the Browser. This results in several advantages:</p>
      <ul class="kanji">
        <li>No need to install.</li>
        <li>Runs on any device with a capable web browser.</li>
        <li>A css based interface that tends to be easier on the eyes.</li>
        <li>Your files are synced online, available anywhere.</li>
        <li>The project is totally free to use, unlike Scrivener.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="Hemingway"><a href="https://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a>: Your Editor before you have an Editor.</h2>
      <p>Hemingway is a web based app used to edit your text after you've written your first draft. It helps you make your text more readable by showing three things:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Adverbs</dt>
        <dd>Adverbs are a natural part of the english language, regrettably an adverb + verb combo will almost always have lower impact and worse reading comprehension than if you used a more appropriate verb in the first place.</dd>
        <dt>Complicated Words</dt>
        <dd>While the intellectual might be convinced that large words are a sign of a distinguished writer, it couldn't be further from the truth. As a writer, your goal is for your work to be eminently understandable by the masses. Large words hinder that.</dd>
        <dt>Passive voice</dt>
        <dd>Passive voice is much weaker than active voice, so Hemingway highlights instances of it for you to help you fix it.</dd>
